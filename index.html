					<p><img id="imgPArticle" src="http://www.world-of-lucid-dreaming.com/image-files/how-to-have-wake-induced-lucid-dreams-feature.jpg" />A lucid dream is any dream during sleep in wich you become aware that you're dreaming. Lucidity occurs during altered states of consciousness when you realize you are dreaming - and your brain switches into waking mode inside the dream. In normal dreams, your self awareness is shut down. That's why they often feel fuzzy and distant. But when lucid, the conscious brain wakes up during sleep. This is a safe and natural state. It is not anything spooky or paranormal. With lucid dreams, you are always asleep in bed.<br/><br/>This simple realization snaps your waking consciousness into the dream, enabling you to explore your dreamworld with total clarity. Everything you see, hear, touch, taste and smell can be as authentic as reality. It is truyly mind-blowing to discover this virtual world. Fulfill any fantasy. Fly over mountains, go base jumping, shapeshifting, time traveling, dinosaur spotting, ninja fighting, meeting your hero and visiting alien planets. Overcome personal psychological issues. In the safety of the lucid dream environment you can face your fears, phobias, anxieties, nightmares, past traumas and recurring dreams. Tap into your inner creativity. In surreal and unexpected ways, you can make music, seek original artistic imagery and solve technical problemas. <br /><br />Experts agree that everyone has the potential to lucid dream. But only a small fraction of people learn how to do it on a regular basis. This site is for people who are serious about lerning the art of lucid dreaming and exploring its real world applications.
